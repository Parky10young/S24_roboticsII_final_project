Action Strategy Outline

Show robot the object
Robot begins mapping process
Builds map w/obstacles
Begin search process for object
If cannot find object, change position (using map and trajectory) and try again
Loop 4-6 until recognize object
Begin trajectory/pathfinding toward object
Move according to the path
Stop within 30cm of object
Send signal, sound alarm

Search process:
Spin until recognition or 360 (send coordinate of recognized object to trajectory)
Take note of where robot has looked (mapping)
Move behind obstacle/to somewhere it hasn't looked (send coordinate of somewhere next to/behind an obstacle to trajectory)
Repeat 1-3 until find object
